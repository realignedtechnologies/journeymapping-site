### How do I include issues from multiple projects

Configure a backlog in the top right hand corner.
When you select a board, make sure the board filter includes
all projects. You can also use a filter instead of a board if needed.

Sometimes Jira will not return the backlog items if not all
workflow status are mapped to the backlog column in the board.

### I can't find Journey Mapping App in the project sidebar

You need "Edit Issues" permission in the project in order to use the journey mapping features. 
Please check with your project administrator.

### Cloud: Where do you store data?

All journey maps are saved in Jira project properties. That means none of your data is stored
outside of your instance.

The app functionality is delivered from our EU data center (Helsinki, Finland).

### On Premises: Does your app communicate outside of the instance?

No, the app is free of any tracking or analytics software.
We also do not do in-product marketing for our paid apps.
